I have successfully followed the comprehensive tutorial on building a universal app using Expo. This tutorial is designed to guide developers in creating a versatile application that seamlessly runs on Android, iOS, and the web, all from a single codebase. The tutorial covers a wide array of topics, from setting up an Expo app to handling platform differences and configuring essential components like status bar, splash screen, and icons.

## About this Tutorial

The primary goal of this tutorial is to introduce developers to Expo and provide a hands-on experience with the Expo SDK. Throughout the tutorial, we dive into essential topics that include:

1. **Create an Expo App:** Set up the foundation of the application.
2. **Implement Layout with Flexbox:** Break down the app layout and implement it using flexbox.
3. **Media Library Integration:** Utilize each platform's system UI to select an image from the media library.
4. **Sticker Modal Creation:** Develop a sticker modal using React Native's `<Modal>` and `<FlatList>` components.
5. **Add Touch Gestures:** Enhance user interaction by adding touch gestures to stickers.

7. **Handle Platform Differences:** Address platform-specific variations between Android, iOS, and web.
8. **Configuration Completion:** Finalize the app by configuring a status bar, splash screen, and icon.

### Tutorial Structure

The tutorial is self-paced and segmented into eight chapters to accommodate both continuous learning and breaks. Each chapter includes all the necessary code, allowing developers to either follow along by building the app from scratch or refer to Snack examples for code snippets.
